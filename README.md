### About me

Hi, I'm Rocky (Hiroki Ueno) from Japan 🇯🇵  
Currently based in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦

I started my career as a software developer in Japan, and now I'm diving deep into web development — mainly with React, Next.js, and the MERN stack.
I'm passionate about building things that are genuinely useful and love exploring what users truly need — not just what they say they want.

Outside of coding, I love traveling and have visited 16 countries so far 🌏 

Thanks for visiting my GitHub. Feel free to reach out anytime!
